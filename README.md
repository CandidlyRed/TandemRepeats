# Pathogenic Tandem Repeats Model Codebase

## Overview

This repository contains code for a model designed to identify pathogenic tandem repeats in genomic sequences. Tandem repeats are repetitive DNA sequences that are prone to expansion, leading to various genetic disorders.

Our work builds on previous work from the following papers:

  Trost, B., Engchuan, W., Nguyen, C.M. et al. Genome-wide detection of tandem DNA repeats that are expanded in autism. Nature 586, 80–86 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2579-z

## Usage

    Most code and processing was done on Google Colab, to use those files, import all the directories into google drive and run accordingly

    Some analysis was performed with R. To use, install R Studio and input our files and install all required dependencies.
